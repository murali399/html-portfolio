<h3>Bagavanth Kesari</h3>
<p>Nelakonda Bhagavanth Kesari (Balakrishna) wishes Vijaya Lakshmi, aka Viji (Sreeleela), to become strong and brave. He wants her to join the Indian Army for a solid reason. However, Viji has no interest in it. Meanwhile, Rahul Sanghvi (Arjun Rampal) pursues her for a compelling reason. What motivates his pursuit of Viji? What is the connection between Bhagavanth Kesari and Viji? Did Bhagavanth have a prior connection with Rahul Sanghvi? Did Viji join the Army? All these questions will be answered in the movie</p>
<h3>Leo</h3>
<p>Parthiban (Thalapathy Vijay) runs a cafe in Theog, Himachal Pradesh. He is a normal family man who lives with his wife Satya (Trisha) and two children. One day a few goons attack Parthiban’s cafe and they threaten to kill his daughter and a worker there. With no option left, Parthiban kills the gangsters, which lands his family in trouble. When Parthiban is going through all this fuss, gangsters Antony Das (Sanjay Dutt) and Harold Das (Arjun) come into his life, and they believe Parthiban is their family member, Leo Das (Thalapathy Vijay). Who exactly is this Leo Das? What happened to him? How did Parthiban manage to get out of all this turmoil? This is what the rest of the film is about</p>
<h3>Mad</h3>
<p>MAD is about three happy-go-lucky guys: Manoj (Ram Nithin), Ashok (Narne Nithin), and Damodhar (Sangeeth Shoban) studying in an engineering college. They kill time by being involved in petty fights in college. Manoj falls for Shruthi (Gouri Priya), while Jenni (Ananthika) loves Ashok. Damodhar is the kind of guy who isn’t interested in relationships, but things change when a girl named Vennela starts calling him daily. The rest of the film showcases the college experiences of these three friends.</p>
